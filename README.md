# Doctor Panel Project

A comprehensive doctor appointment panel allowing patients to book appointments, doctors to manage schedules, and administrators to oversee the system. This full-stack application is divided into three parts:

* **Backend** (RESTful API):  [https://doctor-pannel-server.onrender.com](https://doctor-pannel-server.onrender.com)
* **Frontend** (Patient view): [https://doctor-pannel-project-new.vercel.app/](https://doctor-pannel-project-new.vercel.app/)
* **Admin Panel** (Administrator view): [https://doctor-pannel-project-admin.vercel.app/](https://doctor-pannel-project-admin.vercel.app/)

## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to set up the project locally.

### Prerequisites

* Node.js (v14+)
* npm or Yarn
* MongoDB instance (local or cloud)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/abdulmusawwir2/Doctor-Pannel-Project.git
   cd Doctor-Pannel-Project
   ```

2. **Setup Backend**

   ```bash
   cd server
   npm install
   ```

3. **Setup Frontend (Patient)**

   ```bash
   cd ../client
   npm install
   ```

4. **Setup Admin Dashboard**

   ```bash
   cd ../admin
   npm install
   ```

### Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the `server` directory with the following variables:

```env
PORT=5000
MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
EMAIL_USER=your_email@example.com
EMAIL_PASS=your_email_password
```

### Running the Application

In separate terminals, start each part:

* **Backend**

  ```bash
  cd server
  npm run dev
  ```

* **Patient Frontend**

  ```bash
  cd client
  npm start
  ```

* **Admin Panel**

  ```bash
  cd admin
  npm start
  ```

The server runs on `http://localhost:5000`, patient client on `http://localhost:3000`, and admin panel on `http://localhost:3001` (if configured).
